  Richard P. Feynman was born in New York City on the 11th May 1918. He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he obtained his B.Sc. in 1939 and at Princeton University where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1942. He was Research Assistant at Princeton (1940-1941), Professor of Theoretical Physics at Cornell University (1945-1950), Visiting Professor and thereafter appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (1950-1959). At present he is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Professor Feynman is a member of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the National Academy of Science; in 1965 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society, London (Great Britain).

He holds the following awards: Albert Einstein Award (1954, Princeton); Einstein Award (Albert Einstein Award College of Medicine); Lawrence Award (1962).

  He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

  Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him such as Tuva or Bust! by Ralph Leighton and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.

    <p class="card-text">The stories start with Feynman's childhood, when he figured out how to repair radios and made a reputation for himself doing so around the neighborhood, and run through his career at Caltech. The most memorable are probably the stories of the Manhattan Project, particularly his famous account of how he figured out how to crack the office safes used in the project and then made use of that later on several occasions to recover important files (as well as to play with people's heads). There are few weak stories, though; nearly every one is a gem. Many of them are accounts of how some topic piqued Feynman's curiosity, often with a dare or a challenge as extra incentive, and they're full of fascinating little experiments or practical applications of physics. Very little of it is the deep quantum physics that Feynman is known for. One of his charms is that the everyday physics of daily life seems just as fascinating to him, and he's just as willing to share that fascination as his interest in the deep magic realms of theoretical physics.
